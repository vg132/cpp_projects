	<b>Step 1:</b> Extract the track and jam files you have downloaded into a directory. If the jam files already are in a
	directory with the right name its not a problem, the install program will find them anyway, e.g. if the jam directory is "gp3jamsh/monza/" you can let the jam files stay in a "monza" named sub directory when you install the track.

	<b>Step 2:</b> Go to the directory where you extracted the files to and right click on the track file. Now select the
	"Install" option in the menu that is displayd. This will start the installation program.

	<b>Step 3:</b> Now when the program has started we need to tell the program where we want to install this track.

	Most of the times this info will already be here and you dont have to change it. If there is no path enterd into the
	texts field "Gp3 Path" and "Gp3-2000 Path" enter the correct path to your game (if you dont have Gp3-2000 leve the field empty).
	You can also select if you want to copy the track file to a specified directory. If you dont want to do this then uncheck the
	check box next to the "Browse" button. If you want to copy the track file to a directory you can also enter a new file name
	in the text field if you want to rename the file when you install it.
	<p>
	<b>Step 4:</b> Now when you have made all your selections you need to select what to install.

	Here you can select if you want to install this track for Gp3, Gp3-2000 or both games. Click one of the buttons and the track is then installed for that game :).
